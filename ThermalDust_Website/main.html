                <p>I'm a gamer, Programmer, Geek, also do some 3-D editing. I dont really have much to tell about myself.
                    I would like to state that I'm a Computer Science Engineering Student. I do have many Passions but none of them 
                    persist long enough. I play the game Valorant quite a lot , even tho I'm not really that great at it. I also like to 
                    watch really well made , movies and web series that carry some meaning in them , anyone who wants to suggest me some is 
                    free to do so, I will leave my social media contacts at the bottom of this website.

                <h1>Kenobi#6883<h1>
                <p>Kenobi was a Discord bot that had many functions like Chess.com Profile , Music Bot , Summoning members of a server 
                    through controlled spamming. It could also do many more interactions such as Chat Bot , and also assess toxicity of messages 
                    through Google's Perspective API. Kenobi is an integration of multiple APIs notable ones are Spotify Data API, Discord API ofc, Perspective API,
                    Chess.com Data API. I used to host it on AWS, but sadly now I've decided to stop hosting it after losing interest for a while. But I've still uploaded
                    the code for kenobi's multiple parts on my Github.
