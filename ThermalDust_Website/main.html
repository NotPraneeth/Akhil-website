                <h1>I'm ThermalDust095</h1>
                <p>I'm a gamer, Programmer, Geek, also do some 3-D editing. I dont really have much to tell about myself.
                    I would like to state that I'm a Computer Science Engineering Student. I do have many Passions but none of them 
                    persist long enough. I play the game Valorant quite a lot , even tho I'm not really that great at it. I also like to 
                    watch really well made , movies and web series that carry some meaning in them , anyone who wants to suggest me some is 
                    free to do so, I will leave my social media contacts at the bottom of this website.
